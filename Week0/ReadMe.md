PADDLE GAME
Hit the ball every time it falls to the ground.
Your score increases by 1 everytime the ball
bounces off the paddle. The speed of the ball increases
linearly after every 5 seconds. The game ends when you fail 
to strike the ball back. Chase for the highest score and
flex among your friends 😎😎😎
