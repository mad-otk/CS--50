#--CS--50
# This repo contains mostly the assignments of the CS50 course by Harvard University.
# These are mostly .c or .cpp files, normally for which IDE or gcc compiler is required.
# The codes are written in VSCode and compiled by using a gcc compiler.
# The configuration files(.json) and cpp_properties are also uploaded as specific libraries are required for some problems.
